###### COMPONENTS:

###### Atmega32:

The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family (later Microchip Technology acquired Atmel in 2016). It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.

###### Voltage Divider Circuit:

Voltage divider (also known as a potential divider) is a passive linear circuit that produces an output voltage (Vₒᵤₜ) that is a fraction of its input voltage (Vᵢₙ).

###### LCD Display:

16×2 LCD is a 32 digits display screen for all kinds of CMOS/TTL devices. This word comes from the liquid crystal and 16X2 represents its screen size. In Liquid crystal display 16×2, there are 2 rows and 16 columns.

##### Microcontroller and Memory:

###### Atmega32:

* The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family (later Microchip Technology acquired Atmel in 2016).
* It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.
* The Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 32 KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1 KB EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general-purpose I/O lines, 32 general-purpose working registers, 3 flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented 2-wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8 channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, and 5 software-selectable power-saving modes. The device operates between 1.8 and 5.5 volts. 
* The device achieves throughput approaching 1 MIPS/MHz.

##### Sensors and Actuators:

###### Sensors:

* The potentiometer is basically a long piece of uniform wire across which a standard cell is connected.
* In the actual design, the long wire is cut into several pieces and it is placed side by side and connected at the ends with a thick metal strip.

###### Actuators:

* 16×2 LCD is a 32 digits display screen for all kinds of CMOS/TTL devices.
* This word comes from the liquid crystal and 16X2 represents its screen size. In Liquid crystal display 16×2, there are 2 rows and 16 columns.
